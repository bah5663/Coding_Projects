This web page has a button to press for a random star wars quote. The "normal" or "yoda" radio button must be pressed to add a quote to the table. By default, the table will include all generated quotes. Changing the radio button without changing the quote will transform the quote from normal to Yoda or from Yoda to normal. These results will also be added to the table. If the checkbox is clicked, the table will be cleared and now only the current/transformed quote will be displayed in the table. Unchecking will reset to the default. The Yoda API translates syntax, but for some quotes, nothing changes, but you can still tell that the request was sent to the API because the character name is changed to lowercase. I also added the IsYoda table column for clarity.
